-- Type your code below:

-- As you can see, four columns of the 'movie' table have null values. Let's look at the movies released in each year.

-- Hint: Utilize the COUNT(*) function to count the number of movies.

Combining both the 'movie' and the 'genre' table can give us interesting insights. */

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Q6.Which genre had the highest number of movies produced overall?

-- Hint: Utilize the COUNT() function to count the occurrences of movie IDs for each genre.
-- Hint: Group the results by the 'genre' column using the GROUP BY clause.
-- Hint: Order the results by the count of movie IDs in descending order using the ORDER BY clause.
-- Hint: Use the LIMIT clause to restrict the result to only the top genre with the highest movie count.


/* Output format

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Q7. How many movies belong to only one genre?

-- Hint: Utilize a Common Table Expression (CTE) named 'movie_genre_summary' to summarize genre counts per movie.
-- Hint: Use the COUNT() function along with GROUP BY to count the number of genres for each movie.
-- Hint: Employ COUNT(DISTINCT) to count movies with only one genre.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Q8.What is the average duration of movies in each genre? 
-- (Note: The same movie can belong to multiple genres.)

-- Hint: Utilize a LEFT JOIN to combine the 'genre' and 'movie' tables based on the 'movie_id'.
-- Hint: Specify table aliases for clarity, such as 'g' for 'genre' and 'm' for 'movie'.
-- Hint: Employ the AVG() function to calculate the average duration for each genre.
-- Hint: GROUP BY the 'genre' column to calculate averages for each genre.


/* Output format:

/* Now you know that movies of genre 'Drama' (produced highest in number in 2019) have an average duration of

-- Hint: Utilize the COUNT() function along with GROUP BY to count the number of movie IDs for each genre.
-- Hint: Implement the RANK() function to assign a rank to each genre based on movie count.

-- Q11. What are the top 10 movies based on average rating?
